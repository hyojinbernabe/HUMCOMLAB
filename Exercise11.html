            <p>
                A doughnut or donut is a type of food made from leavened fried dough. It is popular in 
                many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or 
                purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors. 
                Doughnut is the traditional spelling, while donut is the simplified version; the terms are 
                often used interchangeably.

                Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by 
                Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private 
                testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 
                2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. 
                Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video 
                game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active 
                users as of 2021.
